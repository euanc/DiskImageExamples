# DiskImageExamples
A place to host example disk images for using in testing programs that work with them.

I followed the instructions here: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20190605014842/https://askubuntu.com/questions/667291/create-blank-disk-image-for-file-storage

to create the partition table and to format them. 

For now they have no data stored in them. 

Documentation of the formats and partitions is in the included ODS workbook.

Note: total for extracted images + zips is over 237GB
